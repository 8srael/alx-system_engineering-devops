### Postmortem: SSH Authentication Key Issue

##### Issue Summary: Duration: 2 hours (9:00 AM - 11:00 AM, UTC)

##### Impact
Users experienced difficulties connecting to the server using SSH authentication keys during the outage. This affected approximately 30% of the user base, resulting in authentication failures and inability to access the server.

#### Timeline:

- 9:00 AM: An engineer noticed an increasing number of SSH authentication failures and reported the issue to the operations team.

- 9:05 AM: The operations team began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a network connectivity problem.

- 9:15 AM: Network logs and server metrics were analyzed, but no issues were found related to network connectivity.

- 9:30 AM: Attention shifted to the SSH authentication process, specifically focusing on the server configuration and key management.

- 10:00 AM: Investigation revealed that an incorrect public key had been added to the server's authorized keys file.

- 10:15 AM: The incident was escalated to the security team for further analysis and resolution.

- 10:30 AM: The security team identified the root cause as a human error during the key management process.

- 10:45 AM: The incorrect public key was removed from the authorized keys file, and the server configuration was updated.

- 11:00 AM: SSH authentication using keys was restored, and users were able to access the server.

#### Root Cause and Resolution:

  - Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a human error in managing SSH authentication keys. An incorrect public key was added to the server's authorized keys file, preventing successful authentication for affected users.

  - Resolution: The issue was resolved by removing the incorrect public key from the authorized keys file and updating the server's configuration. This ensured that only valid and authorized keys were used for SSH authentication.


#### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

1. Key Management Processes: Strengthen key management processes to minimize the risk of human errors.
	- Task: Review and update the key management procedures, including double-checking key additions and removals.

2. Key Validation Mechanism: Implement a key validation mechanism to verify the correctness of added keys during the key management process.
	- Task: Develop and deploy a script or tool to validate the format and integrity of SSH public keys before adding them to the authorized keys file.

3. Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of the authorized keys file to ensure it only contains valid and authorized keys.
	- Task: Establish a periodic review process to verify the integrity and accuracy of the authorized keys file.

4. Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect any abnormal SSH authentication patterns and identify potential key-related issues.
	- Task: Set up monitoring tools to track SSH authentication failures and generate alerts when anomalies are detected.

5. Training and Awareness: Provide training and raise awareness among the team members involved in SSH key management about the importance of accuracy and attention to detail.
	- Task: Develop training materials and conduct sessions to educate the team on best practices for SSH key management and potential pitfalls to avoid.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the reliability and security of SSH authentication using keys, reducing the likelihood of similar issues in the future and ensuring a smoother user experience.
